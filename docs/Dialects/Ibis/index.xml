In this pass, we lower ibis.path operations by tunneling portrefs through the instance hierarchy, based on the get_port operations that were present in the various containers. After this, various portref&amp;lt;in portref&amp;lt;#dir, T&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ports are present in the design, which represents the actual ports that are being passed around.</description></item></channel></rss>
