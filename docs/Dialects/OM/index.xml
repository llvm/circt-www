This follows in the spirit of other MLIR Rationale docs.
Motivation The goal of the om dialect is to develop an IR suitable for domain modeling. It intends to accomplish this by providing constructs for capturing an Object Model (OM). Domain modeling in this context means capturing design intent and supporting tooling related to the creation of CPUs and SoCs. Anything other than RTL level design entry falls under this broad categorization, and must be intimately tied to RTL level design entry in a stable way.</description></item></channel></rss>
