Please refer to the [LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/GettingStarted.html) 
and [MLIR](https://mlir.llvm.org/getting_started/) getting started in general to
build LLVM and MLIR with extra configurations. Below are quick instructions to 
build CIRCT with LLVM and MLIR.

The following instructions for compiling and testing CIRCT assume that you have
`git`, `ninja`, and a working C++ toolchain.

1) **Check out LLVM and CIRCT repos.**  CIRCT contains LLVM as a git
submodule.  The LLVM repo here includes staged changes to MLIR which
may be necessary to support CIRCT.  It also represents the version of
LLVM that has been tested.  MLIR is still changing relatively rapidly,
so feel free to use the current version of LLVM, but APIs may have
changed.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:circt/circt.git
$ cd circt
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

*Note:* The repository is set up so that `git submodule update` performs a 
shallow clone, meaning it downloads just enough of the LLVM repository to check 
out the currently specified commit. If you wish to work with the full history of
the LLVM repository, you can manually "unshallow" the the submodule:

```
$ cd llvm
$ git fetch --unshallow
```

2) **Build and test LLVM/MLIR:**

```
$ cd circt
$ mkdir llvm/build
$ cd llvm/build
$ cmake -G Ninja ../llvm \
    -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS="mlir" \
    -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86;RISCV" \
    -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
$ ninja
$ ninja check-mlir
```

3) **Build and test CIRCT:**

```
$ cd circt
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake -G Ninja .. \
    -DMLIR_DIR=$PWD/../llvm/build/lib/cmake/mlir \
    -DLLVM_DIR=$PWD/../llvm/build/lib/cmake/llvm \
    -DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=ON \
    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG
$ ninja
$ ninja check-circt
$ ninja check-circt-integration # Run the integration tests.
```

The `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=DEBUG` flag enables debug information, which makes the
whole tree compile slower, but allows you to step through code into the LLVM
and MLIR frameworks.

To get something that runs fast, use `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` or
`-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo` if you want to go fast and optionally if
you want debug info to go with it.  `Release` mode makes a very large difference
in performance.
